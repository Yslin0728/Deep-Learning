Idea behind PyTorch Lightning\n","\n","Codes in a Deep learning project consists of three main categories:\n","\n","1. **Research code**   \n","    This is the exciting part of the experiment where you configure the model architecture and try out different optimizers and target task. This is managed by the `LightningModule` of PyTorch Lightning.\n","    \n","2. **Engineering code**  \n","    This is the same set of code that remain the same for all deep learning projects.Recall the training block of previous notebooks where we loop through the epochs and mini-batches. The `Trainer` class of PyTorch Lightning takes care of this part of code.\n","    \n","3. **Non-essential code**\n","    It is very important that we log our training metrics and organize different training runs to have purposeful experimentation of models. The `Callbacks` class PyTorch Lightning helps us with this section. \n","\n","Let's look at each of these modules in detail.\n","\n","1. **LightningModules** contain all model related code. This is the part where we are working on when creating a new project. The idea is to have all important code in one module, e.g., the model's architecture and the evaluation of training and validation metrics. This provides a better overview as repeated elements, such as the training procedure, are not stored in the code that we work on. The lightning module also handles the calls `.to(device)` or `.train()` and `.eval()`. Hence, there is no need anymore to switch between the cpu and gpu and to take care of the model's mode as this is automated by the LightningModule. The framework also enables easy parallel computation on multiple gpus. \n","\n","2. **Trainer** contains all code needed for training our neural networks that doesn't change for each project (\"one size fits all\"). Usually, we don't touch the code automated by this class. The arguments that are specific for one training such as learning rate and batch size are provided as initialization arguments for the LightningModule.\n","\n","3. **Callbacks** automate all parts needed for logging hyperparameters or training results such as the tensorboard logger. Logging becomes very important for research later since the results of experiments need to be reproducible.\n","\n","All in all, PyTorch is a framework that handles all (annoying) \"engineering\" stuff for you such that you have more time for exciting research and scientific coding. This also results in the advantage that automated parts are guaranteed to be bug-free. Hence, you can't include a bug in a part of your code that is often used but not often checked.
